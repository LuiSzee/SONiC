# About this Manual
This document provides general information about the SONiC Platform Development Environment (PDE).  The SONiC PDE is part of the SONiC Platform Development Kit (PDK) which optimizes platform development.  The SONiC PDK consists of:

-PDDF (Platform Driver Development Framework): For optimized data-driven platform driver and SONiC plugin development. The PDDF details are covered in a separate document.  PDDF：优化平台驱动和SONiC插件的开发

-PDE  (Platform Development Environment): For optimized build and testing of platform and SAI code.  PDE：优化平台和sai代码的构建和测试

The SONiC PDE is generated from the SONiC "sonic-buildimage" repository and is intended to provide ODM and external customers with a means to quickly add, compile and test their platform drivers and static device data required for a fully functional SONiC distribution.  SONiC PDE由sonic-buildimage生成， 目的是提供一个快速添加、编译、测试平台驱动和全功能SONiC发行版所需的静态设备数据的方法

# Scope
This document describes the high level design details on how the SONiC PDE is constructed as well as details on the PDE test suite. The PDE is available to ODMs and others looking to add new platform support, and it optimizes the development and qualification process. It offers a pre-canned, minimal code package to which the ODM can add their necessary platform driver files and static configuration files (required by SONiC to properly initialize SAI and the switching silicon). Furthermore, the PDE will provide a test suite where platform developers can quickly test their drivers and configuration files to resolve issues more easily without relying on the full SONiC application and infrastructure to be in place.  本文档描述SONiC PDE的高层设计以及PDE测试组件的细节。PDE提供给ODM以及其他需要支持新平台的人，PDE优化了开发和验证过程。PDE提供了一个预置的mini的软件包， ODM在上面可以添加他们需要的平台驱动文件和静态配置文件(被SONiC所需以正确的初始化sai和switch芯片)。甚至， PDE还将提供一个测试套件， 平台开发人员可以快速的测试他们的驱动和配置文件，因为不依赖完整的sonic应用和基础设施，所以可以更容易地解决问题

# 1 Requirements Overview

## 1.1 Base SONiC PDE Requirements

The requirements for the SONiC PDE are:
1.  The SONiC PDE repository is generated from the "sonic-buildimage" repository. PDE由sonic-buildimage仓库生成
2.  The SONiC PDE source code tree is generated by a "make initpde" command and generates a codebase that can be provided to an ODM for development. PDE源码树由make initpde生成
3.  The SONiC PDE is packaged with all existing SONiC supported platforms. PDE打包所有现有的sonic支持平台
4.  The SONiC PDE build generates a fully functional ONIE installable image supporting any of the existing included ODM platforms as well as new platforms added. PDE生成一个完整的onie可安装的image， 支持任何已有的ODM平台以及新添加的平台
5.  The PDE is designed to be used on a typical software developer system or virtual machine and does not require a more powerful build server.  
    The minimum requirement for a SONiC PDE build system is a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (VM or dedicated system), with 8GB of RAM and at least 4 CPU cores. PDE被设计成能在一个典型的软件开发者的系统或者虚拟机上使用， 不需要高性能的构建服务器，PDE构建系统的最小需求是：Ubuntu 16.04， 8G ram，4 CPU cores
6.  A new PDE SONiC container is created during the SONiC PDE build process. 在PDE构建过程中会生成一个新的sonic容器
7.  All new unit tests (scripts, binaries, etc) which are generated by or for the PDE reside in the PDE container.  所有单元测试需要的文件都在PDE容器里
8.  All platform drivers and device files will reside in their original SONiC locations as part of the PDE build process. 所有平台驱动和设备文件， 在PDE容器里都将位于sonic原来的位置
9.  The PDE uses the base SONiC build generated Linux kernel, Debian bootstrap image, SAI, root filesystem, and other pre-compiled binaries necessary for booting the PDE ONIE image. PDE使用基础sonic构建系统来生成kernel， debian bootstrap image， sai， rootfs和其他引导pde onie image所需的预编译文件
10. All PDE makefiles and associated supporting files reside in the base SONiC repository as part of the "sonic-buildimage" repository and will not interfere or execute as part of the normal SONiC build process. 所有PDE makefiles和相关的支持文件都放在sonic基础分支里，在构建sonic标准版本的时候将不会执行
11. The PDE supports the existing SONiC porting guide for adding new platform support.  Please refer to [link](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/wiki/Porting-Guide) for more information.  pde支持已有的sonic porting guide

As the PDE New platform changes added in the PDE are seamlessly integrated into the SONiC base repository. 在pde里的改动将无缝集成到sonic base仓库

### 1.1.2 Configuration and Management Requirements
None

### 1.1.3 Scalability Requirements
None

### 1.1.4 Warm Boot Requirements
Warmboot is an important feature in SONiC and a requirement for many datacenter customers. All platforms and their platform drivers are tested as part of the PDE test suite to ensure they do not break the warmboot feature.  The PDE test suite checks to ensure that traffic is not lost during a warm boot.

## 1.2 Design Overview
### 1.2.1 Basic Approach
The PDE source code base is generated from a successfully compiled SONiC build and will contain all the pre-built binaries, scripts, and support infrastructure needed to create a lightweight development infrastructure for platform development.  The PDE will be provided to ODMs and new customers looking to add platform support, where they can add their necessary platform driver files and static configuration files required by SONiC to properly initialize SAI and the switching silicon.  Furthermore, the PDE will provide a test suite where platform developers can quickly test their drivers and configuration files to resolve issues more easily without relying on the full SONiC application and infrastructure to be in place.


### 1.2.2 Container
The PDE build creates a new "docker-pde" container which contains all necessary scripts, binaries, and static configuration data needed to support the PDE and the PDE test suite. Platform drivers and device configuration files remain in their existing locations within the SONiC build and runtime filesystem.

# 2 Functionality
## 2.1 Target Deployment Use Cases

The PDE does not target any type of feature deployment within SONiC. The primary use case is to enable an ODM or customer to quickly add new platform support and run a test suite to ensure that it is compatible with the full SONiC application.

As seen in the diagram below, the PDE consists of a subset of the full SONiC build.  As the SONiC control plane is not needed for platform validation, it is replaced with a PDE test harness which focuses on testing and validating the platform as well as basic functionality of the switching silicon. The PDE is intended to validate and qualify the hardware platform such that it is seamlessly integrated into SONiC where the full function application can be used on the platform.

## 2.2 Functional Description

The SONiC build process has build times that exceed an hour for a full build.  Furthermore, the build system itself has to have at least 50GB of disk storage and multiple CPU cores available for maximum performance.  From an ODM perspective, adding platform driver support, static configuration necessary for SONiC and SAI, and platform plugins is not a complicated process.  The PDE utilizes the pre-compiled binaries (kernel, necessary file system, etc) that were generated in a full SONiC build, and then only compiles and packages the new platform drivers that an ODM adds. This speeds up the build time tremendously and allow for quick turnaround for platform development.

Furthermore, platform developer / enablers do not need to be concerned with a majority of the SONiC application and features. The PDE creates and packages a set of automated and manual tests that ensure the platform drivers are stable and work as required for full SONiC operation, and the switch configuration is correct and allows full traffic flow across the supported port configurations.

### 2.2.3 SAI Overview
The PDE incorporates the necessary SAI / SDK version for the ODM to bring up the ASIC on the target platform.  It is assumed that the base SAI support for the switching silicon has already been tested and verified.

# 3 Design
## 3.1 Overview

The below diagram shows the build process for generating the initial PDE repository.  

![PDE](../../images/platform/initialcreationflow.png)

The below diagram depicts the normal sonic build running with its associated docker containers. The PDE container is not included / active in a regular SONiC build.

![PDE](../../images/platform/sonicbuildcontainers.png)

The below diagram shows the PDE build containing the PDE container.  In a PDE build, this container is active and responsible for interacting with the switching silicon and platform drivers/hardware.  There is no dependency on the remaining SONiC containers in the PDE test environment.
